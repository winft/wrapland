/**
 * @brief Global for server side Display Power Management Signaling interface.
 *
 * A DpmsManagerInterface allows a client to query the DPMS state
 * on a given OutputInterface and request changes to it.
 * Server-side the interaction happens only via the OutputInterface,
 * for clients the Dpms class provides the API.
 * This global implements org_kde_kwin_dpms_manager.
 *
 * To create a DpmsManagerInterface use:
 * @code
 * auto manager = display->createDpmsManager();
 * manager->create();
 * @endcode
 *
 * To interact with Dpms use one needs to mark it as enabled and set the
 * proper mode on the OutputInterface.
 * @code
 * // We have our OutputInterface called output.
 * output->setDpmsSupported(true);
 * output->setDpmsMode(OutputInterface::DpmsMode::On);
 * @endcode
 *
 * To connect to Dpms change requests use:
 * @code
 * connect(output, &OutputInterface::dpmsModeRequested,
 *         [] (Wrapland::Server::OutputInterface::DpmsMode requestedMode) {
 *             qDebug() << "Mode change requested";
 *         });
 * @endcode
 *
