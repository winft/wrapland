/**
 * This is a modeling file for Coverity Scan. Modeling helps to avoid false positives.
 *
 * - A model file can't import any header files.
 * - Therefore only some built-in primitives like int, char and void are available.
 * - Modeling doesn't need full structs and typedefs. Rudimentary structs and similar types are
 *   sufficient.
 * - An uninitialized local pointer is not an error. It signifies that the variable could be either
 *   NULL or have some data.
 *
 * Coverity Scan doesn't pick up modifications automatically. The model file must be uploaded by an
 * admin in the analysis settings of https://scan.coverity.com/projects/wrapland.
