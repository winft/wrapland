/**
 * @short Wrapper for the wp_viewporter interface.
 *
 * This class provides a convenient wrapper for the wp_viewporter interface.
 *
 * To use this class one needs to interact with the Registry. There are two
 * possible ways to create the Viewporter interface:
 * @code
 * Viewporter *vp = registry->createViewporter(name, version);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This creates the Viewporter and sets it up directly. As an alternative this
 * can also be done in a more low level way:
 * @code
 * Viewporter *vp = new Viewporter;
 * s->setup(registry->bindViewporter(name, version));
 * @endcode
 *
 * The Viewporter can be used as a drop-in replacement for any wp_viewporter
 * pointer as it provides matching cast operators.
 *
 * @see Registry
 * @since 5.66
