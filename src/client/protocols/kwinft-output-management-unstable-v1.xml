    <interface name="zkwinft_output_management_v1" version="1">
        <description summary="configuration of server outputs through clients">
            This interface enables clients to set properties of output devices for screen
            configuration purposes via the server. To this end output devices are referenced
            by global zkwinft_output_device_v1 objects.

            output_management (wl_global)
            --------------------------
            request:
            * create_configuration -> output_configuration (wl_resource)

            output_configuration (wl_resource)
            --------------------------
            requests:
            * enable(output_device, bool)
            * mode(output_device, mode_id)
            * transformation(output_device, flag)
            * position(output_device, x, y)
            * apply

            events:
            * applied
            * failed

            The server registers one output_management object as a global object. In order
            to configure outputs a client requests create_configuration, which provides a
            resource referencing an output_configuration for one-time configuration. That
            way the server knows which requests belong together and can group them by that.

            On the output_configuration object the client calls for each output whether the
            output should be enabled, which mode should be set (by referencing the mode from
            the list of announced modes) and the output's global position. Once all outputs
            are configured that way, the client calls apply.
            At that point and not earlier the server should try to apply the configuration.
            If this succeeds the server emits the applied signal, otherwise the failed
            signal, such that the configuring client is noticed about the success of its
            configuration request.

            Through this design the interface enables atomic output configuration changes if
            internally supported by the server.

        <description summary="configure single output devices">
            output_configuration is a client-specific resource that can be used to ask
            the server to apply changes to available output devices.

            The client receives a list of output devices from the registry. When it wants
            to apply new settings, it creates a configuration object from the
            output_management global, writes changes through this object's enable, scale,
            transform and mode calls. It then asks the server to apply these settings in
            an atomic fashion, for example through Linux' DRM interface.

            The server signals back whether the new settings have applied successfully
            or failed to apply. output_device objects are updated after the changes have been
            applied to the hardware and before the server side sends the applied event.

                As an example assume the transform is normal, the mode of the output is 3840x2160
                and the geometry is 1080x1920.

                In this case the geometry can be stretched with factor 1.125 to 1215x2160 and placed
                according to the compositor's internal policy somewhere horizontally on the output.

                But if the transform is set to 90, 270 or the respective flipped values the geometry
                can be stretched with factor 2 to 3840x2160 and fill the whole area sideways.
