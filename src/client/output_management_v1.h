/**
* @short Wrapper for the zkwinft_output_management_v1 interface.
*
* This class provides a convenient wrapper for the zkwinft_output_management_v1 interface.
*
* To use this class one needs to interact with the Registry. There are two
* possible ways to create the OutputManagementV1 interface:
* @code
* OutputManagementV1 *c = registry->createOutputManagementV1(name, version);
* @endcode
*
* This creates the OutputManagementV1 and sets it up directly. As an alternative this
* can also be done in a more low level way:
* @code
* OutputManagementV1 *c = new OutputManagementV1;
* c->setup(registry->bindOutputManagementV1(name, version));
* @endcode
*
* The OutputManagementV1 can be used as a drop-in replacement for any zkwinft_output_management_v1
* pointer as it provides matching cast operators.
*
* @see Registry
* @since 5.5
