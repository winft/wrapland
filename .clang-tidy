# Following checks are disabled:
#
# cert-dcl50-cpp: We need C-style variadic functions for message posting to the
#   libwayland C-library.
# cppcoreguidelines-non-private-member-variables-in-classes: We use public member variables in our
#   pimpl-classes extensively. TODO: Could be enabled for API classes only or all Private classes be
#   transformed into structs.
# cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-array-to-pointer-decay: Need array decay for C-style variadic
#   function.
# cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-member-init: Produces false positives with template classes, see
#   https://stackoverflow.com/q/55569776.
# cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-vararg: See cert-dcl50-cpp.
# fuchsia-default-arguments-calls: We allow default arguments.
# fuchsia-default-arguments-declarations: We allow default arguments.
# fuchsia-overloaded-operator: We overload | for enum classes through Q_DECLARE_OPERATORS_FOR_FLAGS.
# google-build-using-namespace: We do allow using namespaces for now. Might make sense to
#   reevaluate this decision at some point in the future.
# google-readability-namespace-comments: Often unnecessary verbose, with C++17 namespaces there are
#   not many braces after all.
# google-runtime-references: We generally allow reference parameter passing as is common in C++.
# hicpp-member-init: See cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-member-init.
# hicpp-no-array-decay: See cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-array-to-pointer-decay.
# hicpp-vararg: Same as cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-vararg.
# llvm-header-guard: We use #pragma once.
# llvm-namespace-comment: Same as google-readability-namespace-comments.
# llvm-qualified-auto: We use auto without qualifiers when not needed like C++ Core Guiedelines do.
# misc-non-private-member-variables-in-classes: See
#   cppcoreguidelines-non-private-member-variables-in-classes.
# modernize-use-nodiscard: Putting the nodiscard qualifier at every little getter seems
#   weird. Other C++ libraries also don't seem to do that. For now disable it.
# modernize-use-trailing-return-type: The non-trailing return type style is
#   easier to read and is preferred.
# readability-implicit-bool-conversion: We use it quite often, it does not really
#   improve the readability to explicitly cast everywhere.
# readability-qualified-auto: Same as llvm-qualified-auto.
#
# Temporarily suppress (might be possilbe to remove or limit to certain subdirectories later on):
# cppcoreguidelines-macro-usage: We currently still depend on some macros in Output implementation
#   and some other classes where the Qt functionality can't be easily migrated to templates.
# cppcoreguidelines-owning-memory: We have yet to fully define a structure without the need of raw
#   owning pointers. This is a long-term goal that needs more work on the layering of the server
#   structure until complete.
# cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-reinterpret-cast: Qt macros like Q_DECLARE_METATYPE use
#   reinterpret_cast.
# cppcoreguidelines-special-member-functions: Pimpl classes in public API need dtors, might be
#   possible later on to remove Pimple or the need for dtors and use rule of zero.
# hicpp-signed-bitwise: Qt macros like Q_DECLARE_OPERATORS_FOR_FLAGS conflict.
#   hicpp-special-member-functions: See cppcoreguidelines-special-member-functions.
